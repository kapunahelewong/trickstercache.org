# Trickster Documentation Site

This repo contains the Trickster documentation. Currently, we are creating the docs site infrastructure and information architecture.

Thank you to @nananananate for laying the groundwork with the excellent [MkDocs](https://www.mkdocs.org) and [MkDocs Material](https://squidfunk.github.io/mkdocs-material/). ðŸŽ‰
