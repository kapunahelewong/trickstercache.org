# PromSim Update

We've created a new project called [Mockster](https://github.com/tricksterproxy/mockster) that incorporates all the features of PromSim, verbatim. We hope you'll check it out!

The PromSim packages and libraries are removed from the main Trickster project, and we'll remove this notice with the release of Trickster v1.2.
